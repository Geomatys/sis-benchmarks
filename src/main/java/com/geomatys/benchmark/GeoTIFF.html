    <h1>GeoTIFF reader/writer performance comparison</h1>
    <p>
      <a href="https://sis.apache.org">Apache Spatial Information System (<abbr>SIS</abbr>)</a> version 1.4
      contains a Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (<abbr>COG</abbr>) reader for raster data.
      The development branch of Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> 1.5 (not yet released at the time of writing this blog) contains also a GeoTIFF writer.
      Those reader and writer are implemented in pure Java code for avoiding the difficulty of bindings to native libraries such as <abbr>GDAL</abbr>.
      Pure Java code also provides more flexibility for Java developers. For example, the Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> reader
      accepts any implementation of the Java <code>ReadableByteChannel</code> standard interface as the source of bytes.
      Another reason for developing GeoTIFF reader and writer in Java was for prototyping the use of new GeoTIFF keys
      that are proposed in <a href="https://www.ogc.org/initiatives/t-19/">OGC TestBed-19 — Geospatial in space</a>.
    </p><p>
      Coding yet another GeoTIFF reader and writer seems a duplication of work,
      since most of the geospatial world uses the popular <abbr>GDAL</abbr> library for that purpose.
      But actually, from Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> perspective, there is not so much duplication.
      The most difficult part in a GeoTIFF reader and writer is to handle tiling and compression efficiently.
      But this task is largely format-independent, and <abbr>SIS</abbr> needs also to handle netCDF and other formats.
      The Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> library shares code internally,
      thus reducing the task of GeoTIFF support to header parsing.
      By contrast, <abbr>GDAL</abbr> is largely an aggregation of independent libraries
      such as <code>libtiff</code> and <code>libpng</code>, each with their own ways to resolve common problems.
    </p><p>
      Nevertheless, coding GeoTIFF support in Java raises questions about how its performances compare to <abbr>GDAL</abbr>.
      There is a widespread belief that Java programs are slower than their C/C++ counterpart.
      In reality, it depends a lot on the kind of application and how the libraries were coded.
      Differences in algorithms can play a bigger role than differences in the programming languages.
      This blog will not answer that debate, because the benchmarks presented here depend a lot on native code,
      either for I/O operations or for <code>DEFLATE</code> compression
      (the latter is handled by native code in the <code>java.util.zip</code> standard package).
      However, the benchmarks in this blog demonstrate the capability of a Java program to avoid adding overhead.
      The result is that Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr>, at least in those benchmarks, compares favorably with <abbr>GDAL</abbr>.
    </p>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <p>
      The benchmarks reported in this blog are very limited and only scratch the surface on the topic of raster data handling:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>All benchmarks were tested with a single image (in two variants).</li>
      <li>Only one compression method tested (in two variants), together with uncompressed raster.</li>
      <li>No sub-regions and no sub-samplings tested (there is no technical reasons for this omission).</li>
      <li>Multi-thread parallelization not tested (would have required some more developments in Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr>).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Sub-regions and requests for reduced resolutions on <abbr>COG</abbr> images should be handled efficiently by Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr>,
      but benchmarking those features would have required a more complex setup,
      especially if we want to test in a cloud environment.
      The simple benchmarks in this blog used a single image which was always read fully, from a local file on a laptop.
      The image was a single non-<abbr>COG</abbr> raster with the following properties:
    </p>
    <table style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto">
      <tr>
        <th>Raster thumbnail</th>
        <th>Raster properties</th>
      </tr><tr>
        <td>
          <img src="GeoTIFF.jpg" alt="Thumbnail of the image used for benchmarks">
        </td>
        <td style="padding-left: 60px">
          <table>
            <tr><td>Producer:</td>         <td>DigitalGlobe</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Image date:</td>       <td>2014/06/16</td></tr>

            <tr><td>Image size:</td>       <td>8192 × 8192 pixels</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Strip size:</td>       <td>8192 × 128 pixels</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Sample model:</td>     <td>banded (3 separated arrays of red, green and blue).</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Sample type:</td>      <td>bytes, values ranging from 2 to 255.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Compression:</td>      <td>None</td></tr>

          </table>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      The image was read and rewritten using three libraries: <code>gdal_translate</code>, Java Image I/O and Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr>.
      For each library, the read/write operations were repeated 10 times in order to allow the Java Virtual Machine to warmup.
      The two first iterations were ignored, and execution time of the remaining 8 iterations were recorded.
      Average times and standard deviations are reported in this blog.
      In the particular case of the <abbr>GDAL</abbr> library, the execution time of <code>gdalinfo</code>
      has also been measured and its average value has been subtracted from all <code>gdal_translate</code> times.
      The intend is to take in account the time needed for loading the <abbr>GDAL</abbr> binary,
      or at least the parts required for reading the image header
      (it also incidentally includes the time for parsing that header).
      We apply this correction because our benchmark code relaunches the <abbr>GDAL</abbr> command in each iteration,
      contrarily to Image I/O and Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> libraries which are loaded only during their first iteration.
      The benchmark code is <a href="https://github.com/Geomatys/sis-benchmarks">available on GitHub</a> in the <code>GeoTIFF.java</code> file.
      The processor of the test machine was Intel Core i7-8750H and the operating system was Fedora Linux 38 (Workstation Edition).
      Read and write operations were performed in the <code>/tmp/</code> directory, which uses the <code>tmpfs</code> file system.
      It means that the raster files reside partially in <abbr>RAM</abbr>, so the benchmarks have less delay caused by I/O operations.
    </p>

    <h3>Method with deflate compression</h3>
    <p>
      The same tests were executed again with the <code>DEFLATE</code> compression.
      That compression is performed by the <code>zlib</code> library,
      accessible in standard Java thought the <code>java.util.zip</code> package.
      However, the <code>zlib</code> performance varies greatly depending on the data to compress.
      For fair comparisons, we must ensure that all the tested libraries write the same data.
      It is not the case by default because:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><abbr>GDAL</abbr> and Java Image I/O change the sample model from "banded" to "pixel interleaved".</li>
      <li><abbr>GDAL</abbr> changes the strip height from 128 pixels to 1 pixel, thus writing strips of 8 kb.</li>
      <li>Java Image I/O changes the strip height from 128 pixels to 8 pixels, thus writing strips of 64 kb.</li>
      <li>Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> keeps the sample model and strips height as they were in the image that was read.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For avoiding those differences, the input image has been rewritten by Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr>
      with a "pixel interleaved" sample model and strips of 8 pixels in height.
      In addition, the <code>-co BLOCKYSIZE=8</code> option has been passed to <code>gdal_translate</code>.
      A <code>DEFLATE</code> compression has been applied, so the tests will include decompression times
      in addition of compression times.
    </p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>
      First, we tested reading the uncompressed image and rewriting it uncompressed too.
      Average execution times are reported below.
      The "<abbr>GDAL</abbr> (reduced)" label means that the average execution time of
      <code>gdalinfo</code> has been subtracted from the execution time of <code>gdal_translate</code>.
    </p>
    <table class="report">
      <caption>Read and write an uncompressed image</caption>
      <tr><th>Library</th>                     <th>Time (s)</th> <th>Std. dev.</th> <th>File size (bytes)</th></tr>
      <tr><td><code>gdalinfo</code></td>       <td>0.07</td>     <td>± 0.001</td>   <td></td></tr>
      <tr><td><abbr>GDAL</abbr> (reduced)</td> <td>0.26</td>     <td>± 0.002</td>   <td>201 351 742</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Java Image I/O</td>              <td>0.29</td>     <td>± 0.03</td>    <td>201 334 968</td></tr>

    </table>
    <p>
      Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> appears faster than other libraries for this particular benchmark.
      It may be because Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> does not reorganize the pixel layout:
      it writes the image with <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.desktop/java/awt/image/BandedSampleModel.html">banded sample model</a>
      (called "planar configuration" in TIFF), as it was in the image that <abbr>SIS</abbr> has read.
      By contrast, <abbr>GDAL</abbr> and Image I/O reorganize the pixels into the
      <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.desktop/java/awt/image/PixelInterleavedSampleModel.html">pixel interleaved sample model</a>.
      Note that for a Java application, the Java2D architecture around the <code>Raster</code>, <code>SampleModel</code> and <code>ColorModel</code> classes
      provides a great level of abstraction, generally making unnecessary to restructure the image data.
    </p>

    <h3>Results with deflate compression</h3>
    <p>
      The next benchmark involves reading the same image but with pixel interleaved sample model and deflate compression, then rewriting that image.
      First, the compression was tested without predictor. The average execution times are reported below.
      The same <code>gdalinfo</code> measurement than in the previous benchmark is reused for the "GDAL (reduced)" column.
      No attempt was made for instructing <abbr>GDAL</abbr> to use <code>libdeflate</code> (see below):
    </p>
    <table class="report">
      <caption>Read and write an image with deflate compression and no predictor</caption>
      <tr><th>Library</th>                     <th>Time (s)</th> <th>Std. dev.</th> <th>File size (bytes)</th></tr>
      <tr><td><abbr>GDAL</abbr> (reduced)</td> <td>9.20</td>     <td>± 0.04</td>    <td>117 522 070</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Java Image I/O</td>              <td>8.99</td>     <td>± 0.01</td>    <td>117 522 062</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr></td>     <td>9.04</td>     <td>± 0.03</td>    <td>117 522 062</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      The benchmark has been repeated many times and Java Image I/O was consistently slightly faster than other libraries.
      One hypothesis may be that, by default, Image I/O reads the whole image as one single tile, while the other libraries does tiling.
      We have not tried to adjust Image I/O parameters for testing that hypothesis.
    </p><p>
      Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> appears slightly faster than <abbr>GDAL</abbr> in this benchmark,
      but we should not make general conclusion from this observation because the Java profiler measured
      that <abbr>SIS</abbr> spend about 95% of its time in the <code>java.util.zip</code> native code.
      We presume that a similar proportion applies to <abbr>GDAL</abbr> as well,
      so 95% of this benchmark is probably comparing the same code.
      We have no certain explanation for the slight difference nevertheless measured between <abbr>GDAL</abbr> and <abbr>SIS</abbr>.
      One hypothesis may be that the startup time estimation based on <code>gdalinfo</code> is not good enough.
      Another hypothesis may be that Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr>'s efforts payoff.
      <abbr>SIS</abbr> tries hard, sometime at the cost of code complexity, to transfer data as directly as possible
      (i.e. avoid copy operations from one buffer to other temporary buffers before the final destination).
    </p><p>
      Note that <abbr>GDAL</abbr> has the capability to
      <a href="https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/pull/3068">use <code>libdeflate</code> instead of <code>zlib</code></a>,
      with a reported performance gain of 35-50%. This acceleration has not been tested in this benchmark.
    </p>

    <h3>Results with horizontal differentiating predictor</h3>
    <p>
      Adding the horizontal differentiating predictor at writing time has the same effect on the two tested libraries.
      The difference between them are within margin errors, so no conclusion can be made.
      The "Time increase" column is the difference between the time measured here and the time measured in the benchmark without predictor.
      The majority of this increase is probably caused by time spent in <code>zlib</code> instead of time spent in applying the predictor.
      Note that the file sizes also increase.
      The image used in this test is a case where applying a differentiating predictor is counter-productive.
    </p>
    <table class="report">
      <caption>Read and write an image with deflate compression and horizontal differentiating predictor</caption>
      <tr><th>Library</th>                     <th>Time (s)</th> <th>Std. dev.</th> <th>Time increase (s)</th> <th>File size (bytes)</th></tr>
      <tr><td><abbr>GDAL</abbr> (reduced)</td> <td>13.25</td>    <td>± 0.3</td>     <td>4.04</td>              <td>121 997 027</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr></td>     <td>12.93</td>    <td>± 0.2</td>     <td>3.89</td>              <td>121 997 020</td></tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Because the benchmarks spent 95% of their time in the <code>zlib</code> library (except for the uncompressed case),
      we cannot make conclusion about the performance of the Java code in Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr>
      compared to the C/C++ code in <abbr>GDAL</abbr>.
      However, the benchmarks suggest that Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> is successful in its attempt to avoid adding overhead.
      The interfacing between Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> and <code>java.util.zip</code> and <code>java.nio</code> packages
      (e.g. using <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/ByteBuffer.html#direct-vs-non-direct-buffers-heading">direct buffers</a>)
      seems as efficient as the interfacing between <abbr>GDAL</abbr> and the native libraries that it uses.
      The benchmark measurements were slightly in favor of Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr>, but close to margin errors.
      Furthermore, a bias may exist despite our effort to apply a correction for <abbr>GDAL</abbr> startup time.
    </p><p>
      The benchmarks reported in this blog are a bit superficial and could be improved in many ways:
      benchmarks should be run on a lot of different images with different sizes, tilings, sample models and color models,
      benchmarks should request various sub-regions, enable parallelization, measure raster reprojection times,
      measure memory consumption, <i>etc</i>.
      However, doing fair performance comparisons of the writers is time-consuming,
      because it requires making sure that each library compresses the same data.
      They usually don't, because of different choices in sample models and tile sizes.
      Adjusting the parameters of each library for comparing the same things may need to be done on a case-by-case basis.
    </p><p>
      However, we can probably conclude one thing: the widely spread belief that a C/C++ library such as <abbr>GDAL</abbr>
      will surely be faster than an equivalent Java library such as Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> is not always grounded in reality.
      It is true in some circumstances (e.g. startup time of a Java application stay longer), but should not be generalized.
      Slow Java codes are often due to poor algorithms rather than the language.
      More benchmarks between libraries written carefully in both languages are needed before to make conclusions.
