# Apache SIS benchmarks
This repository contains code used for measuring the performances of
[Apache Spatial Information System (SIS)](https://sis.apache.org/)
compared to other libraries. This repository is referenced by the
"method" section of blogs for allowing tests reproduction.
There is no production-ready code here,
but this repository may nevertheless be useful as code examples.

## Requirements
This Maven project depends on the development branch of Apache SIS (a `-SNAPSHOT` version),
because the benchmarks are often used for testing new features.
The Apache SIS development branch needs to be compiled locally.
